# typing_speed_meter
A Python speed test project typically involves measuring the execution time of a specific piece of code or a function. You can achieve this using Python's built-in time module. Here's a simple example of a Python speed test project:
The code you've provided is a Python script for a typing speed test program. Here's a breakdown of what the code does

It imports the time and random modules to measure time intervals and generate random sentences for typing tests.

Two functions are defined:

mistake(partest, usertest): This function calculates the number of errors between the provided correct text (partest) and the text entered by the user (usertest).

speed_time(time_s, time_e, userinput): This function calculates the typing speed in words per second based on the start time (time_s), end time (time_e), and the user's input (userinput).

The script includes a list of test sentences for users to type.

It enters a while loop that continues until the user decides to exit.

Inside the loop:

It prompts the user to type "yes" or "no" to indicate if they are ready to start the typing test.

If the user enters "yes":

A random sentence is chosen from the list of test sentences.
The selected sentence is displayed for the user to type.
The user is asked to press Enter to start the timer.
The script records the start time.
The user types the sentence.
The script records the end time.
It calculates and displays the typing speed in words per second and the number of errors made.
If the user enters "no", the program exits with a "Thank you!" message.

If the user enters anything other than "yes" or "no", it displays an "Invalid input" message.

Overall, this script allows users to practice typing by providing random sentences from the list and then gives them feedback on their typing speed and the number of errors they made during the test. Users can repeat the test as many times as they want until they choose to exit
